# cedict\_to\_sqlite
Converts CEDICT into a SQLite database

You must download [CC-CEDICT](https://www.mdbg.net/chinese/dictionary?page=cc-cedict),
extract the zip, and rename the data file to cedict.txt. Eventually I'll
probably automate the process.

# Requirements
* Python 3+

# Usage
` python3 cedict_to_sqlite.py `
